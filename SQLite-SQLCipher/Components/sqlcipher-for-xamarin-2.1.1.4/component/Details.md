[SQLCipher](http://sqlcipher.net) provides transparent and secure 256-bit AES encryption of SQLite database files using established [security practices](http://sqlcipher.net/design/). SQLCipher is a popular and widely deployed platform, used daily in many commercial and open source applications.

### Strong Security for Mobile and Embedded Databases

**No special knowledge of security or cryptography required!** Use a standard ADO.NET or sqlite-net compatible API while SQLCipher takes care of data security behind the scenes.

SQLCipher has a small footprint and great performance so it's ideal for protecting embedded application databases and is well suited for mobile development. Key features included:

1. Optimized for Xamarin
2. Same API on iOS and Android
3. Simple configuration
4. 100% of database is encrypted
5. ADO.NET and sqlite-net compatible APIs
6. Low overhead encryption ([as low as 5-15%](http://sqlcipher.net/blog/2011/5/7/sqlcipher-performance-and-sqlcipherspeed.html))
7. High performance with indexes and transactions
8. Starts up and closes down quickly
9. Works well on large databases
10. Algorithms provided by [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) crypto library
